AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian Agriculture
This project explores Indian agriculture using district-level crop data from ICRISAT. It focuses on analyzing crop production, area cultivated, and yield trends across different states and years using Power BI, SQL, and Python.

What the project does:
Shows how much rice, wheat, maize, and oilseeds are grown in different states

Highlights top crop-producing states and districts

Compares crop yield (output per hectare) between regions

Visualizes how the area cultivated affects total production

Provides interactive Power BI dashboards with filters by crop, state, and year

Tools Used:
Power BI for dashboards

SQL for data queries

Python for data cleaning and analysis

Key Outcomes:
Identified trends in major crop production over 50 years

Found top-performing regions for oilseeds and cereals

Built easy-to-use visuals for farmers, researchers, and policymakers
